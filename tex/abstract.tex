Nowadays, data has become one of the most important role players of the industry. Considering the amount of data being generated in every second, the capability of handling this huge amount of data and converting it to a more practical format which demands a high level of expertise has been a quite challenging issue. As storing and handling this data is considerably expensive and urges a great deal of expenses to the industries, it is so important to get as much benefit as possible from the data. In this paper we try to facilitate the ingestion and analysis of a big dataset in matter of time and computation by implementing different algorithms like sentiment analysis and several queries and counting examples in Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark which are two data frameworks for handling big data.
